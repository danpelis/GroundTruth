# Machine Learning Classifiers for Prediction Generation

This directory contains the notebook files used for both ML classifier methods we used to generate predictions, as described in the report. 

**Method 1** was our more naive approach, where we utilized the weight vectors generated by the models to get a weighted average of the album, artist, and average genre ratings in order to determine which 3 tracks to recommend for each user.

**Method 2** focuses on improving our predictor matrix by adding in additonal features to better represent the genre ratings. We also generated a test heirarchy-based matrix with all the same features as the predictor matrix. Rather than looking at a weight vector, we passed the entire testing heirarchy into the trained models, and used the raw probabilities that a track should be recommended to determine which three of the 6 tracks we would recommend.
