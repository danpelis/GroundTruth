# Random Method

`RandomSuggest.ipynb` this notebook will take in the userSuggestions.csv file and randomly sort the IDs for every user's test set. It will then apply 1's
to the first three IDs and 0's to the last three. It will then organize the IDs back into their proper order and write the results to the 
randomSuggestions.csv file.

`randomSuggestions.csv` this is the output submission file of the RandomSuggest.ipynb notebook.

`userSuggestions.csv` this is an example submission file.
