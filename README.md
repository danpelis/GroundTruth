- Weighted Average
- Matrix Factorization
- Machine Learning Methods
- Random Method

Many of the methods in this repository depend on a data folder that has not been included due to GitHub file size limits. To run any of these methods one must create a data folder inside the method's directory and fill it with the data provided on the class's Canvas page.
