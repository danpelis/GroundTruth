# Matrix Factorization Notebook

The notebook file `Matrix_Factorization_ALS.ipynb` is used to perform ALS matrix factorization using pyspark on the training data. The test data is then passed through the model and the resulting prediction values are used to determine the top three recommendations for each set of users. This method is described in detail with a discussion on our results in the report document.
